// There are two roles,  USER and ADMIN
// There are also profiles which store a users data, each profile has a unique user
// (each user doesnt specifically have a unique profile, however we should make sure that this is the case)
// Admins do not have profiles 
// We use profiles to match people and decide what workout type or style they are into that day
// The user is purely for backend categorization and logging purposes
// We also have workouts which are used to store the workouts being writtten
// They will be sorted by type and later by experience
